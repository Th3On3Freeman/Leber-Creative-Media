                                    <p>Welcome to my list for the best television shows of 2017. All of these are shows that I watched this year to their completion (with a few exceptions that are listed in their respective entries). I was first inspired to create this list by my friend Antonio, who is an excellent writer and runs his own list every year as well. I'd also like to thank my girlfriend and mother; both helped me proofread these entries. Feel free to check out his list at the link below:</p>

                                        <p class="mainText"><i>Homeland</i> used to be one of the most engaging shows on television. It had a compelling premise, a great pair of leads and it had a keen knack for tapping into current events. These days, Homeland's premise has gone soft, with the original premise long since abandoned, and every year has been an attempt to reboot with a different idea. This year the writing staff, and the rest of the world, was caught off guard when the 2016 presidential election didn't go as planned. In order to remain relevant the writing staff was forced to completely rework several storylines and I'd wager that has a lot to do with what went wrong here because this is the first truly bad season of <i>Homeland</i>. When the last season was ending, it appeared that Rupert Friend was on his way out of the show. Instead, what happened was the writers doubled down and gave him the biggest storyline he's ever had. I personally think that Rupert Grint was doing the best he could with what he was given, but what came out of all of this was wasn't just bad: it was boring. Step it up <i>Homeland</i>, you've got two years left.</p>

The trials and tribulations of the Baudelaire orphans were a welcome respite from the horrifying days of public education, and the writer's unique wit added a touch of sarcasm that you too might enjoy. However, I'm sorry to inform you that the Netflix iteration of this tale is dull, dreary and disasterously boring. The orphans' torturer, Count Olaf, is played with conviction by Neil Patrick Harris, but that doesn't necessarily make him very pleasant to watch. I might keep watching this, but it often feels like a chore to get through and I'm not a huge fan of it.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText"><i>24</i> used to be a phenomenon. Starring Kiefer Sutherland, it was a post 9/11 show that dialed into Americans' need to see terrorist plots foiled and brought to justice. After eight seasons of Jack Bauer kicking ass, it ended and except for a brief return in <i>24: Live Another Day</i>, the Kiefer Sutherland era of 24 is officially over (at least as long as <i>Designated Survivor</i> remains on the air). So when <i>24: Legacy</i> was announced with no Jack Bauer I wasn't exactly thrilled. It certainly looks like the <i>24</i> from the old days, but Corey Hawkins brings nothing new to the table. It became very clear that this was not an attempt to imitate Kiefer Sutherland's heightened performance, but what we got instead was a reserve of quiet intensity that never really went anywhere. Since the season ended, <i>24: Legacy</i> has been cancelled, and while there are rumblings of another iteration of the franchise in the works, unless Kiefer Sutherland returns I'm not expecting much.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">2017 has certainly been an interesting year for the X-Men franchise. After the disappointment that was <i>X-Men Apocalypse</i>, X-Men had a very strong rebound with the fantastic <i>Logan</i>, by far the best Wolverine movie ever made. In addition to that, two X-Men TV shows premiered this year: the spectacular <i>Legion</i> (more on that later) and <i>The Gifted</i>. Featuring two stellar leads with Stephen Moyer (<i>True Blood</i>) and Amy Acker (<i>Person of Interest/Angel</i>), I had high hopes for this show. While I'm not completely caught up on this one, from what I've seen this show has some potential, but it's ham-strung by predictable plotlines and too many characters. Beyond the two actors I mentioned (while they receive top billing, they aren't always the focus of what's going on), the rest of the cast is just okay. The other problem is that the stakes just don't seem very high; this often feels like a network television show, despite the visual effects work. The last episode I saw added some more heart and character development, so I'm going to stick with it, but hopefully the writers are going to break some of these shackles and move into more interesting territory.</p>

Your flashbacks are getting duller and more irrelevant than ever. Your villains are becoming cartoonish and haphazard. Sure, every once in a while you can still make me feel something, but then you gotta go and muck it up. You even went and pulled a <i>Lost</i> and did an episode focused on how your (former) main character got her tattoos! Girl, get your shit together!</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">It is impossible to talk about <i>House of Cards</i> now without mentioning the Kevin Spacey scandal. It has irrevocably impacted the show's proceedings going forward and also colored previous seasons in a different light (there were storylines that focused on exploring Frank Underwood's repressed homsexuality, which now ring more true than ever after what has happened). The fact of the matter is that despite Kevin Spacey's firing, <i>House of Cards</i> is in a better place than ever to tackle this type of challenge given the way this season ended.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="mainText">Regarding the season itself, while not as strong as the previous season this was still pretty good. The introduction of the new characters played by Patricia Clarkson and Campbell Scott as the advisors pulling the strings added an interesting new dynamic, both with each other and those they're advising. Meanwhile, the election storyline grew more engaging, and the end of the season left Robin Wright's Claire Underwood with a huge win. Very interested to see how the upcoming final season plays out, all things considered.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText"><i>American Horror Story</i> has been in a bit of a rut the past couple years. <i>Hotel</i> favored style over substance and suffered a poor lead actress, while <i>Roanoake</i> didn't know what it wanted to be, shifting between styles so often that none of them really had a chance to take hold (although the general change in format was good for the series at the time). They did, however, have one constant: a charismatic and compelling performance from Evan Peters, who has slowly morphed from the shy innocent pretty boy he became over the course of the show and back to his captivating villianous roots that he showed in <i>Murder House</i>. This was by far his biggest role yet in any <i>American Horror Story</i> season as he portrayed a variety of different cult leaders over the course of the season, in addition to Kai Anderson. There was also a clear reaction to the 2016 presidential election when it came to how executive producer Ryan Murphy framed this season's setting and context. This gave the serious a necessary jolt, and also tied in to its themes of empowering women (epitomized most by the guest appearance of Valerie Solanas and the transformation of Sarah Paulson's character). While the plot lost it's focus as the season progressed, this was definitely a cut above <i>Hotel</i> and <i>Roanoake</i>, though still not reaching the heights of <i>Asylum</i> and <i>Murder House</i>. Let's see if it can continue this upward swing.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">After a lackluster second season, <i>Fear the Walking Dead</i> came back and completely changed the way it worked, killing off a main cast member right off the bat and introducing a whole new way of life. The introduction of Brokejaw Ranch has resulted in a sharp increase in quality that has made me feel like the showrunners finally know what the hell it is they're doing compared to the schizophrenic nature of the second season. And with this farm comes a whole new gaggle of hens, introducing the Otto family and their quarrel of with the Native Americans. Dayton Callie (Deadwood) as Jeremiah Otto has some great material here with Kim Dickens' Madison that made me feel like I was watching <i>Deadwood</i> all over again. Meanwhile, the return of Ruben Blades as Daniel Salazar has greatly increased my interest going forward after his unceremonious exit last year, considering he was one of the best actors in the cast. There are still some rough edges here and there (it still feels like Alycia Debnam Carey (The 100) is being far too underutilized), but this is definitely a step in the right direction. I hope the second half of the season keeps this up.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText"><i>Outlander</i> ended on a very poignant note last year, capping a great second season off with a powerful finale. This year, however, felt quite different. Instead of two distinct arcs (one in Paris, the other back in Scotland), season three of <i>Outlander</i> began with a divided narrative, out of necessity due to the decision to split the two leads across different timelines. This provided an interesting change, only one of the narratives was far more compelling than the other one. The marital clashes between Claire and Frank were far more interesting to watch compared to the plodding Jamie episodic arcs (which would get bursts of energy whenever the character of John Grey returned). Meanwhile the second half of the season was a deranged smorgasboard of different arcs, including one in the middle that felt far too stretched out simply because the production team wanted to take advantage of some leftover ships from their sister show <i>Black Sails</i> (which finished it's run on Starz earlier this year). Among other arcs (including a rather amusing one where it's Claire VS THE WILD!), the penultimate episode managed to bring together a surprising amount of disparate elements that started to make the season feel like some huge grand plan. Disappointingly, the finale couldn't live up to that promise, but hey at least there was less rape this year.</p>

                                        that were made for quite a few of the episodes this season. For example: the second episode of the season was entirely centered around Nora, my favorite character. This was great, but a huge part of why people loved this episode was because of the many allusions 
                                        to another television show called <i>Perfect Strangers</i>. Having never seen that show, all of this was completely lost on me. Another example of a poor creative decision came in the finale when an impactful ending from an earlier episode in the season was 
                                        completely undone because it made the writers upset. It completely undercuts that earlier episode and adds a sour taste upon any rewatch. There are other problems I have as well (such as the lackluster third episode), but those don't erase the great moments 
                                        (such as a certain hotel room scene) that also occurred. They just make opening the refrigerator seem a little less appetizing.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">I was not as big a fan of Fargo season two as the rest of the world seemed to be. What was being hailed as the second coming came across to me like a lot of characters that I didn't care about in a storyline that wasn't particularly interesting (minus Kirsten Dunst [Spiderman], who was fantastic). I vastly preferred season one, so when I saw the promos for season three I was skeptical but hopeful. <i>Two Obi-Wan Kenobi's? Oh and I see you're bringing in Carrie Coon to win me over as well.</i> In the end while it didn't quite reach the heights of the first season, this was a vast improvement upon season two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim VS the World/10 Cloverfield Lane) is a breath of fresh air and the aforenmentioned Carrie Coon gave a very different performance compared to <i>The Leftovers</i>, so kudos to her on range. Meanwhile, there was an interesting dichotomy between Ewan McGregor's (Star Wars) twin brother characters that turned into a blood feud as the season progressed. And when it came to the villain, while he didn't surpass Billy Bob Thorton's amazing antagonist from season one, David Thewlis (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) gave a suitably chilling performance that filled my appetite. Hope there's a season four coming eventually, however unlikely that may be.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">As <i>Game of Thrones</i> approaches it's endgame it had done so with a startling increase in speed. While we have been privy to long-awaited developments (Daenerys arriving in Westeros, meeting Jon Snow, finally beginning to interact with the rest of the cast), it has come with a cost. Long gone is the <i>Game of Thrones</i> of old with it's carefully constructed plotlines and respectful, if slow at times, approach to storytelling. In it's place now is a willingness to dive forward multiple strides in an episode that would normally take five times as long, ten times as long even in some cases. While this has streamlined elements that were previously frustrating it has inadvertently ruined other huge moments that occurred this season. Yes, some scenes escape unscathed (such as the first meeting of Jon Snow and Daenerys, which, while not featuring particularly great actors is still masterfully executed), but others (such as the battle beyond the wall) are so incredibly contrived it begs to question why Benioff and Weiss are so rushed. Could this not have taken a bit more time? Is one more season's worth of episodes too much to ask for? I can only hope that the critical reaction to this season has made the creative team retool their approach to the back half of this final season or it may very well destroy the ending of such an ambitious show.</p>

                                        because it was replacing something that had grown near and dear to my heart. And no, this is not as good as <i>Hannibal</i>, but what it does have going for it is ambition. Also based on a previous work, American Gods is far more reminiscent of the 
                                        experimental first half of <i>Hannibal</i> season three, oozing with style and transforming itself week to week as different gods are introduced. The parable sequences in each episode are all very unique and add a different flavor to each episode as each god arrives in America. Some of the stylistic and artistic choices can be a bit much at times, but this is still one of the most unique new shows this year. Ian McShane (<i>Deadwood</i>) is on a road trip with Ricky Whittle (<i>The 100</i>), and while recent behind the scenes troubles leave the show's future in doubt, this is a show worth keeping in your prayers.</p>

That all changed in season two, when he became the most important member of the cast. Suddenly, the trivial drama of what was happening to Will didn't seem so important anymore once the high drama began between Steve and Nancy - after all, can anyone ever forget where they were the first time they heard Nancy declare</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">Is there are more famous quarrel in Hollywood than the feud between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford? These were two women who were at the height of their careers until the cruel mistress that is time caught up with them and executives like Jack Warner left them in the dust. That is, until a plot was concocted behind closed doors to turn them against each other in order to fuel audience interest. Suddenly reporters like Hedda Hopper were all ears again for anything the two of them had to say, manipulating them to twist their words into statements that resulted in horrible public insults against each other. All of this and more was explored in the first season of <i>Feud</i>, a new anthology series created by Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story/American Crime Story) to go along with his other sister series. Along with him comes his star attraction Jessica Lange (American Horror Story), playing Joan Crawford against Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis. There's a raw palpability throughout the tragedy of what was done to these two that feels particularly current given the recent developments in how Hollywood has treated women. Can't wait to see the feud that's tackled next year.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">Based on Margaret Atwood's original novel, <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> is without a doubt the most talked about and breakout show this year. It's going to be near the top of many other people's lists this year, and many people are going to agree with them. It stars Elizabeth Moss (Mad Men), and has become more current than it's writers could have ever foreseen given the way the election results ended up swinging. So why, you may ask is it not closer to the top of my list? This world is a dystopian future where fertile women are rare, and because of this they have been forced into servitude and are regularly raped by their captors. This does not result in a television show that is particularly pleasurable to watch. I found myself never truly feeling like I was in the right mood for the way this show makes you feel, and even though I can attest to its quality I simply enjoyed the other shows below this entry more. That being said, I still highly recommend this.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">When David Simon created <i>The Wire</i>, it was not a breakout hit. Sure, it was recognized by the critics, but it never received a single award from the Emmys. It also never really became a part of the mainstream consciousness until long after it was over. Enter the present and it is almost universally considered one of the best television shows of all time, for the way it tackled the issues within the city of Baltimore; the incredible acting from the likes of Idris Elba and Clarke Peters; and the compelling writing, particularly in it's later years. So when <i>The Deuce</i> was announced, expectations were pretty high. It again features great acting, this time particularly from Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gary Carr (though really the whole cast is great). It also features a dual performance from James Franco as twin brothers, just as <i>Fargo</i> did earlier this year. I wouldn't say it's the best thing on television right now, but it definitely has the right look and feel to it; it just remains to be seen whether or not it will match up to it's pedigree.</p>

                                        this is different from something like <i>Dexter</i> or <i>True Detective</i>. Instead of being told from the killer's perspective or the FBI exclusively, <i>Mindhunter</i> finds a way to meld the two together as it actively explores criminal 
                                        psychology. The interview scenes with patients like Ed Kemper are nothing short of fascinating and the return of Anna Torv (<i>Fringe</i>) to television (albeit a bit underused here) is a welcome sight. In my personal opinion, this is the best new show of the year.</p>

                                        <p class="mainText">What a comeback. The first season of <i>Mr. Robot</i> made a huge impact on me, with a great pace and focus that the second season unfortunately lost. Don't get me wrong, these were still great characters (and new ones) that we were following, but most of the excitement was gone, instead replaced with head games and a lot of smoke and mirrors. However, the third season is a huge return to form; it starts with a bang and then utilizes the rich character development accomplished in the previous season while bringing back the rollercoaster. Portia Doubleday is finally given a more interesting role throughout this season after her encounter with the mysterious Whiterose and it instantly made me captivated every time she was onscreen. The real kicker comes at the midpoint of the season with two episodes that are among the best the series has ever done. The first is an extremely calculated work of film that must have taken an insane amount of time to put together and even broke conventional network standards in a way that I've never seen before. Meanwhile, the second episode may not be quite as ambitious but what it does have going for it is a combination of nail-biting tension and a catastrophic conclusion. I haven't even mentioned the huge shift in the relationship between Rami Malek and Christian Slater's characters, which completely changes the dynamic of the show.
