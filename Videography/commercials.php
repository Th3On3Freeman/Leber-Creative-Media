                                    <p>One of the most common uses for a camera is promotion and advertisement. Every successful business needs a voice and what better way to grab someone's attention than with a commercial? These are the projects that I've worked on in order to enhance and bring a brand into the public eye.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">During the course of my time doing freelance web development, I've become fairly well acquainted with <a href="http://adam-taylor.com/" target="_blank">Adam Taylor</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.mywebsitespot.com/" target="_blank">MyWebsiteSpot.com</a>, which I regularly have done freelance development for. So when he learned of my interest and experience in video editing, he introduced me to one of his clients: <a href="http://www.paradisepoolsbydesign.com/" target="_blank">Paradise Pools By Design</a> and I was given the opportunity to redo and fix a promotional timelapse video that was previously compiled from still images by another company.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">After discussing changes with the client, I made significant changes to the video, shortening it drastically because it was far too long for their purposes, as well as tightening up some slow segments, merging audio segments to maintain flow and incorporating graphic design elements made by another developer at MyWebsiteSpot.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">When I first heard about the <b>Campus MovieFest</b> event happening at the University of Central Florida, I was intrigued. Create something in one week! It was intimidating to say the least.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">So I threw my hat into the ring and was recruited by <i>Odie Cabalsci</i> and <i>Caroline Castille</i> to help with their project. Most people in this event were attempting to make short films, but Caroline and Odie had an existing brand they wanted to use this as a chance to promote called <b>bSteps</b>. I was recruited as a valuable asset because of my editing work and also because I had a camera.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The first, and most interesting part of this process was filming. I had never been on anything close to resembling a <b>Film Set</b> before now, and I quickly learned how stressful they can become. We had to coordinate everyone to be available for hours each time to film multiple short sketches that would be compiled into a single commercial. It was here I met with <i>Emilio Andres</i>, as well as <b>Director</b> and <b>Special Effects Editor</b> <i>Luis Penedo.</i> Being on set proved to be an invaluable experience in learning how commercials are made.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The second part of the process was our all-night editing session, with most of the production crew packed into a single room with little more than pizza and our wits trying to pull it all together. With direction and advice from everyone involved I was able to construct the three-part commercial and we submitted it on time to the event.</p>
