                                    <p class="mediaDesc">I first began editing Live Action Music Videos with <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/765427-REG/Adobe_65107693_Premiere_Pro_CS5_5_for.html" target="_blank">Adobe Premiere CS5.5</a> in 2012. I never submitted these to contests for years because all of the contests I went to only accepted music videos with anime content. That changed when I went to <a href="http://awa-con.com/" target="_blank">Anime Weekend Atlanta</a> in 2014. From then on I began submitting my live action videos from past and present in whatever contest would accept them.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="mediaDesc">Live Action Music Videos work a little bit differently than Anime Music Videos. You have far less visual expression in anime, so imagery without much movement can be boring. Meanwhile, with animation you usually can get far more fluid movement and it can be easier to make fluid sequences. There's also the general stigma in the anime community about using dialogue in your music video. Unless you're doing this for comedic purposes, the reaction to this dialogue is going to be polarizing.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="mediaDesc">There's a division in the audience between those who watch the original japanese (frequently referred to as <i>subs</i> because of the subtitles that go along with this method of watching) and those who watch the english (frequently referred to as <i>dubs</i> because of the <i>dubbing</i> that english voice actors provide), and fans of the subs will frequently chastise most dubs for bad acting or inaccurate translations. The difference in a live action video is that, at least in my case, the original language is english and because of the style I've incorporated with enhancing the narrative with trailer-esque or short stories my approach has been more accepted.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">I could never be a comedian.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="centerText">There's a particular combination of memorization, improvisation and wit required to run a gig like that and while I may not have the chops to pull that off, there are others that certainly do.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">And one of those is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/" target="_blank">The Marvelous Ms. Maisel</a>. Starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014031/" target="_blank">Rachel Brosnahan</a> and streaming on Amazon Prime, the show's focus is on Miriam Maisel: a housewife from the 1950s who decides to take her life into her own hands and after a life-altering moment, becomes a comedian. The show's rhythmic dialogue and family dynamics have made it one of my favorite shows of the past few years.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">So I already knew I wanted to make a music video with this source but in the brave new world of peak television with streaming services everywhere you turn, not everything gets a home release anymore so I had to turn to bootleg emmy voter dvds for source footage (ironic since you can stream the show in 4K).</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">When it came to the song I had recently rewatched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103477/" target="_blank">The Little Mermaid</a>, and as these things go I was constantly picturing aspects of the video, but in this case it was one scene in particular: <a href="https://youtu.be/sf-M99Isoxs?t=51" target="_blank">0:51-1:00</a>, by far the scene that I knew I wanted to portray from the beginning. Beyond that, there were just a lot of parallels for me between the lyrics of Jodi Benson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKlJuO07eM" target="_blank">Part Of Your World</a> and Miriam's story about wanting to leave her cozy little life and be under the spotlight.</p> 

                                            <p class="centerText">In the end this video wasn't nominated for anything at AWA PRO. There were some criticisms made over the live action lip synching throughout as well as some confusion over the relation of the song to the source material, but ironically, locally, it was considered one of the best videos I've ever done. A strange disconnect between the editing community and the casual viewer I suppose. Maybe I should I have submitted it to Expo.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">When you've been making music videos for as long as I have, sometimes you have to subvert expectations.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="centerText">An example of a good reaction to subverting expectations was when Alfred Hitchcock killed his apparent protagonist only 30 minutes into the film Psycho. On a more modern note, Game of Thrones and Avengers: Endgame would further build on that legacy with their own shockers.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">An example of a more mixed reaction to subverting expectations was when Rian Johnson changed the way storytelling worked in Star Wars, and united a flame in fandom culture that still hasn't died down yet.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">Now when it came to my video, it was more about subverting the expectations of what people have come to expect from me, though there are some content aspects to be discussed as well.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">I've never made a video with a Britney Spears song before, but this is just one of those songs that seeps into your brain over the course of your life and takes hold. I typically stay away from stuff this popular or this mainstream, but when I was thinking about Orphan Black, it just matched so well for me.</p> 

                                            <p class="centerText">Speaking of clone club, my video has an all-star cast starring Tatiana Maslany and...that's about it. There's some others present, but she plays a ridiculous amount of characters on this show and the video primarily focuses on the five main clones:</p> 
                                            
                                            <ul class="list-group">

                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">While featuring some brief cameos from the following clones:</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc"><b>Beth</b> - (seen briefly in the opening montage, intercut w/Sarah)</p>

                                            <p class="centerText"><b>Krystal</b> - (Intercut w/Sarah at 1:10)</p>

                                            <p class="centerText"><b>Mika (M.K.)</b> - (Seen in the opening and ending montages, sheep mask)</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">Now beyond that, this is the first time I've attempted to tell a fast paced story more in line with the type of video you'd more typically see as an AMV in a live action format. This can definitely make it a little harder to follow for newcomers to the material but I think it gives the video an energy some of my other material lacks.</p> 

                                            <p class="centerText">And lastly there's the ending. Some of you might feel like it comes out of nowhere, some may think it's gratuitous and some may cry spoiler for a six year old plot twist, but I personally think the video builds up to it in an organic manner given the fact that there are multiple forces attempting to take Sarah's child throughout the video (including Rachel and Helena), and the final result is that none of them take them from her, but for some random freak accident. Thus, subverting expectations.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I first heard this song when I was playing the first portion of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235780/MINERVA/" target="_blank"><i>Minerva</i></a> Half-Life 2 mod titled <i>Metastatis</i> (or <i>Carcinogenesis</i>) in 2007. There was a song that would play in it titled <a href="https://youtu.be/QoUC23vl0y8" target="_blank"><i>Absconditus</i></a> that stuck with me. So much so that when I knew I wanted to create a Hannibal music video, it suddenly clicked that this was the perfect song.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">In 2015, Hannibal, one of the darkest, most artistic television shows ever made came to a close. It captivated my attention while it was on, and it hasn't left my mind since.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">From the very first frames of the video you can tell that there's something wrong with Will Graham. When he's kissing Alana Bloom, you can see the madness consuming his mind with his twisted interpretation of what's occurring.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">For the next segment, you may notice some sound effects that aren't in the song. I added those and experimented a bit, slowing down and reversing certain sound effects to get the intended twisted sound I was looking for.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This video is very heavy on dialogue. I had to spend a long time equalizing the song with the dialogue so that everything was very clear in comparison to the song in the background. This was particularly difficult with Mads Mikkelsen because he has a very thick accent that took a while for me to balance correctly. This also applied to sound effects like gunshots.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">There was also a lot of cross-cutting I used with completely unrelated sequences to accomplish my storytelling. One such example was from <a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=65" target="_blank">1:05-1:15</a>. Another example is <a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=144" target="_blank">2:24-2:43</a>. Both of these sequences, while the cross-cutting relates to the dialogue are about completely different subjects than the scenes which they are cut against.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">While I was working on this video, I went to an art show and found a piece of art that inspired me. The artist told me a story about how it depicted their friend's son that was going through a difficult time in their life involving drugs, their own kind of madness if you will and I think you can see the visual correlation between the two (particularly from <a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=90" target="_blank">1:30-1:54</a>, which is probably the start of my favorite segment in the video)</p>
                                            
                                            <img src="/images/music-videos/live-action/madness-art.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Art piece depicting the madness the artist's friend's son was enduring.">
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The next section (<a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=144" target="_blank">2:24-3:10</a>) shows how Hannibal manipulates Will into eating the flesh of Abigail Hobbs (afterwards, having had twisted nightmares he ends up throwing up her ear). This is probably the closest thing I have to a climax in this video, which is atypical of most structures in that the climax is subdued compared to most typical storytelling.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">For about the final two minutes of the video (roughly <a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=204" target="_blank">3:24-5:07</a>) I tried something a little different and that was a took a single monologue and used it as is for the backdrop for this portion of the video. Typically if I use dialogue (as I did for the rest of the video) I mix and match different statements together to achieve the pace I want but this particular exchange worked for me as-is. This sequence uses future events of the show, but is still very true to the conversation they're having.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The final part of the video (<a href="https://youtu.be/HGnQvlTiveo?t=307" target="_blank">5:07-5:36</a>) is the coda, using a mix of moments previously seen in the video and other shared moments between Will and Hannibal to create a microcosm of the story told in the rest of the video.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This is definitely one of my favorite videos I've ever made.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This video was initially inspired by the love of my life. She has always loved <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077631/" target="_blank">Grease</a>, but neither of us had heard this cover until it was used on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/" target="_blank">The Leftovers</a>. She didn't care much for that show, but she loved that cover; so I kept that in mind.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">Later in our relationship I introduced her to <i>Homeland</i>. It took a little while for her to latch on at first, but by the halfway point of the season she was hooked and I knew I'd finally hit a winner. We proceeded to marathon through the other five seasons and over time I realized that combining her two favorite things just might be the right idea. So I decided to give it a shot.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The opening of the video <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=5s" target="_blank">(0:05-0:10)</a> is a mix between foreshadowing of the ending and the struggle that a woman (named Carrie) is feeling about what occurs over the course of the video. The following portion from <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=11s" target="_blank">(0:11-0:42)</a> is a fantasy as Carrie and a man (named Brody) explore their time together, blissfully in love and unaware of what lies ahead of them.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The turning point comes next, at <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=43s" target="_blank">(0:43-0:58)</a>. Suddenly, the spell is broken and Brody leaves her alone, heartbroken. This is when we learn that Brody has a family that he has knowingly betrayed, with a wife that has been waiting for him and he is filled with regret. It was once I was putting this sequence together that I finally felt like the video was beginning to come together. This continues in the next portion, from <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=59s" target="_blank">(0:59-1:14)</a>, where Carrie can't get past the feelings she has for a man that has abused her and used her; meanwhile, he gets to receive counseling and reconciliation.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">At <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=1m15s" target="_blank">(1:15-1:39)</a> they embrace each other once more. However, for Brody this time it's not the same. He can't get the faces of his children out of his mind: a confused daughter, an innocent son. And finally, the memory of a faithful wife, pushing him over the edge and away from Carrie once again. She is not taking this well.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">We now follow them on their separate journeys, from <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=1m40s" target="_blank">(1:40-1:59)</a>, as they navigate the mess they've made for themselves. Brody goes on a spiritual walk through a forest, leading to a lake where he prays for guidance. Carrie is in the midst of a psychological break as she collapses onto the bed. This continues from <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=2m" target="_blank">(2:00-2:26)</a>, as she has a dream that makes her realize that she is now pregnant. As she realizes the full implications of what this means, she envisions a future where she raises this child alone, and this shakes the fabric of her world.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The action now shifts, at <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=2m27s" target="_blank">(2:27-2:32)</a>, back to Brody's family and things are not going well. The facade has not held up and his family life is now shattered, this man is now a husk of his former self. The final portion of the video, from <a href="https://youtu.be/AFTA-W4vK04?t=2m33s" target="_blank">(2:33-2:45)</a>, shows Carrie reaching back out to Brody once more, pulling him out of the wreckage of his former life. Their lives will never be the same, but maybe now they can build a better future.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc"><i>The 100</i> is a TV show that has a cast that first and foremost centers around rebellious teenagers. I first heard this song in the season two finale of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/" target="_blank">The Leftovers</a>, and one time when I was listening to it I realized just how perfectly it matched these characters.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This is a character profile video focused on Octavia and her journey from a free spirited teenage girl to a hardened warrior. Her primary relationships that are explored throughout are with her brother Bellamy and her lover Lincoln. I called the video <i>The Butterfly</i> because of the focus on Octavia's transformation and also because of the perfect shot of Octavia coming out of her cocoon at <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-5LDel_CQ?t=2m18s" target="_blank">2:18</a>. I added the shot of Octavia admiring the other butterflies at <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-5LDel_CQ?t=39s" target="_blank">0:39</a> later to help sell this analogy.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">A new technique that I incorporated into this video was cross-cutting with spatial similarities. This was used to add a new visual dynamic and to help sell themes of love and sacrifice. Examples of this can be found from <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-5LDel_CQ?t=1m44s" target="_blank">1:44-1:46</a> with the christ-like shot of Lincoln and again when he is falling after being shot from <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-5LDel_CQ?t=2m0s" target="_blank">2:00-2:04</a>.</p>

It was nominated for the <i>Best Live Action</i> award at AWA and won the <i>Genisys is Skynet</i> award at Youmacon.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I came up with the idea for this video when I was listening to the part of this song that starts in this video at about <a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=4m53s" target="_blank">4:53</a>, and I knew I wanted to make a tragedy. Not only did the song fit the material extremely well, but it was written for a movie that was written by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634300/" target="_blank">Jonathan Nolan</a>, the same writer who would go on to make <i>Person of Interest</i>, the show that is used in this video. However this song is originally 16 minutes long, so I grabbed the portions I knew I wanted to include and put them together in a version that ultimately ended up being roughly 7 minutes instead.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I knew for sure I was going to lead up to these major tragedies, but I wanted to justify it, and not just throw them in the video for shock value. So I decided to start with the concept that brings these people together (<a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE" target="_blank">0:00-1:46</a>), then I established the two primary relationships (<a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=1m47s" target="_blank">1:47-2:55</a>), after that I introduced trials for the characters, and this is also the darker 2nd half, as well as foreshadowing for the ending (<a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=2m56s" target="_blank">2:56-4:52</a>), next is the build up to the climax and the climax itself (<a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=4m53s" target="_blank">4:53-6:21</a>) and finally the falling action and the ending (<a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=6m22s" target="_blank">6:22-6:46</a>). I didn't want to end it after the climax because that's a rather nihilistic ending and I wanted to leave some hope after the tragedies ensued.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7cFsTIbrTY" target="_blank">Shades of Reality</a>, this was a huge return to the idea of dialogue enhancing the narrative, but on a far bigger scale than any video I had done previously. Unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaoG-VuY5gA" target="_blank">Honor and Vengeance</a>, this was a far more linear story, focusing on two core relationships that both lead to catastrophic consequences. I have been criticized by some in the past because of the length of this particular video but I believe each piece in this narrative is necessary and to shorten it in order to appeal to a mass audience would cheapen and diminish the effect it has.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The most experimental sequence that I created in this video was the build-up to the climax from <a href="https://youtu.be/5p-ZHvSF0WE?t=4m53s" target="_blank">4:53-5:18</a>. The idea with this sequence was that the character Shaw is having a mixture between a psychotic break and a premonition telling her that if she stays with her lover Root that the world is going to end and she has to sacrifice herself in order to save her friends. That sequence, and the following breakdown with Root against the chains was the whole reason I wanted to make this video in the first place. The slow-motion tragedy was already part of the footage from <i>Person of Interest</i>, but the way that it plays out in my video was inspired by the opening of a film called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1527186/" target="_blank">Melancholia</a>. I am very satisfied with how this ultimately turned out.</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">This is a music video that I submitted to <a href="http://awa-con.com/" target="_blank">Anime Weekend Atlanta's</a> <a href="https://awa-con.com/the-video-art-track/" target="_blank">Video Art Track Expo</a> in 2016.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The initial concept for this video was to combine an assortment of <i>beautiful imagery</i>. This was also the first music video I had made in a while, so I was trying to get my feet wet again.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">Originally this video was going to incorporate dialogue from the character Rust Cohle from the first season of <i>True Detective</i>, but I 
                                            ultimately couldn't find anything that fit the vision I wanted to portray within the video. So what ultimately ended up onscreen is a little more abstract than I initially intended. If I were to clarify it, the story is about the end of the world, and a man who has a vision that a massive comet is going to destroy it. However, what he doesn't realize is that he's having visions about other worlds, parallel universes in a sense. This is why when he goes to the bar because he's in a pit of despair and can't get these visions out of his head, he continues to have visions of this other world. Some people are able to escape this catastrophe on space ships while others are left behind. In the end, the man is unable to stop the other universe from collapsing and is left to contemplate what he could have done to stop it.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">When I first saw <i>Les Revenants</i> (or <i>The Returned</i>), I knew this was the song I wanted to use. It has a mysterious sense of wonder and I thought it fit perfectly for the vibe I wanted to portray. I always knew I wanted to use <i>Super 8</i>, but the idea to use <i>True Detective</i> came later. I had originally intended to use the original <i>Sin City</i>, but <i>A Dame to Kill For</i> was what I ultimately ended up with. And I originally had a shot in my head from <i>Lucy</i>, but in the end <i>Melancholia</i> ended up being a much better fit. The inclusion of <i>Interstellar</i> footage was to add more wonder and a connecting thread to the True Detective footage.</p>

It won the <i>Best in Show</i> award at Youmacon.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This music video was originally inspired by my sister, who introduced me to this song and inspired me to use it. I thought it would be perfect for <i>Fringe</i> and completed it in time for the one year anniversary of the show's ending.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">Due to this song's heavy use of lyrics and the intensity of the music itself I decided to forego any use of dialogue in this particular video. This let the lyrics and images speak for themselves in a way that I had never done when it came to live action music videos. Unlike in my breakdown of <a href="https://youtu.be/I_qZNU-K1eE" target="_blank">A Broken Home</a> I'm not going to link to individual lyrics because the song ended up fitting <i>Fringe</i> so ridiculously perfectly that it would just be me linking the entire video in countless chunks. However, I will discuss particular sections of this video that I want to emphasize.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">The beginning of the video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7cFsTIbrTY" target="_blank">0:00-0:49</a>) is a specific series of vignettes that serves two purposes: the first is that it worked as a set of varied mood pieces that introduced different elements of the show and the characters that would be further explored. The second is the images that show up before each section: <b>this is actually a code</b>. Throughout the entirety of <i>Fringe's</i> run at every commercial break there would be an image, originally appearing to be something innocent such as an apple. But if you look closer you can see that the seeds are actually human fetuses. There is also a golden dot usually present with these images. These <i>glyphs</i> are actually part of a cypher that gave each episode a secret word that, once fans figured it out, added extra significance for the episode that each word was tied to. I utilized this cypher to dedicate this video to my sister, whose name is spelled out in the order the images are displayed.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc"><i>Fringe</i> was a show about parallel universes. Because of this, each character had <i>doubles</i> and I utilized these variations (or <i>shades</i>) throughout the video with a splitscreen effect (coupled with piano footage) contrasted with the one person in the show who had no <i>double</i> (specifically from <a href="https://youtu.be/W7cFsTIbrTY?t=1m1s" target="_blank">1:01-1:12</a>). In addition to this, I also utilized splitscreen and cross-cutting to showcase spatial similarities across time (from <a href="https://youtu.be/W7cFsTIbrTY?t=49s" target="_blank">0:49-1:02</a>), such as Olivia reliving her horrible childhood memories, Walter walking with a child through a portal into another world and Peter drowning and coming back into existence in the same place.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">From here on out the video becomes more conventional, laying out the story with the lyrics in a more traditional manner. Though at the halfway point I utilized a few brief moments that related to a storyline where Peter had disappeared from existence. Throughout this storyline there were these very brief flickers of him that hinted at a return, which I coupled with the lyric <i>a distant echo</i> (<a href="https://youtu.be/W7cFsTIbrTY?t=2m35s" target="_blank">2:35-2:38</a>). This storyline also figured into how I created the ending, where Walter and Olivia can sense Peter's presence coming back into existence (<a href="https://youtu.be/W7cFsTIbrTY?t=3m59s" target="_blank">3:59-4:06</a>).</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I think one of the reasons why this video was given the attention it was is because in addition to having unique elements, it matched so perfectly against the lyrics that it allowed people who had never seen the source material to appreciate it, while those who had seen the source material could get even more out of it with all the little references I placed throughout.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I came up with this idea when I first heard this song in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0o3C8i6Ugw" target="_blank">Homeland trailer for season three</a>, and I thought it was the perfect fit for a <i>Breaking Bad</i> video.

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">In addition, I also continued my trend of using dialogue to enhance my narrative, especially in these key sequences:</p>
                                            
                                            <ul class="list-group">

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">What this ultimately did was create a new hybrid of video where the dialogue and lyrics played off of each other and combined to become a greater whole. And as everything comes crashing down at the end (<a href="https://youtu.be/I_qZNU-K1eE?t=4m22s" target="_blank">4:22-5:17</a>), I pulled together several different conflicts, such as Jesse getting attacked in the desert, and then saved by Mike; Hank getting attacked in his car; Walt and his wife fighting at the same time Jesse and Walt are fighting; and Gus accepting his fate.</p>

                                            <p class="mediaDesc">This is a music video featuring the titular character that my video editing handle is based off of. It was a different kind of video than I had previously done up to this point. It showcased more of the use of dialogue to 
                                            enhance a narrative that I had previously used, but it also used a song that was a remix of one of the core themes from the show. This certainly made editing this video easier (and, arguably, lazier), but at the same time it also created a 
                                            different kind of vibe compared to my previous videos with the faster paced musical beats leading to a more frantic style of editing.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">One of the key moments in the music that I wanted to utilize was at 1:15. It's at this point that the song kicks into high gear, combining kill sequences, violent black and white animal attack videos (symbolizing Dexter's primal animalistic urges) and scenes of Dexter and his brother in a car which help build the momentum. Moments in this section that I'm particularly proud of include the cross-cutting of Debra looking at photos of her crime scene to when she was actually on the table (<a href="https://youtu.be/ULnXX54fvr8?t=1m23s" target="_blank">1:23-1:25</a>), the way the drop of blood hits Dexter's shoe in time with the music (<a href="https://youtu.be/ULnXX54fvr8?t=1m26s" target="_blank">1:26-1:28</a>) and the splitscreen of Dexter's rogue gallery over the course of the first seven seasons of the show (<a href="https://youtu.be/ULnXX54fvr8?t=1m33s" target="_blank">1:33-1:35</a>; although the timing on this particular sequence was a little off I think it still works).</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I want to address the ending because it could come across as a little confusing. The moment after Dexter says It is over when I say it is (<a href="https://youtu.be/ULnXX54fvr8?t=3m8s" target="_blank">3:08-3:16</a>), is actually cross-cutting between a fantasy that Dexter has of saving his mother as The Dark Defender (in black and white) and his real-life memory of her dying. So the idea is that he's saying that she's not dead until he says she is and that he can bring her back (which is, of course, the fantasy of a psychopath).</p>

                                            <p class="centerText">This is a music video that I submitted to <a href="http://awa-con.com/" target="_blank">Anime Weekend Atlanta's</a> <a href="https://awa-con.com/the-video-art-track/" target="_blank">Video Art Track Expo</a> in 2014 and <a href="http://www.youmacon.com/" target="_blank">Youmacon's</a> <a href="http://www.fanarttheater.com/" target="_blank">Fan Art Theater Contest</a> in 2017.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">I believe this was the first truly successful attempt at making a music video that incorporated dialogue to inform the narrative. There are multiple ongoing storylines throughout and the dialogue from a variety of different characters all flows really well together. As opposed to my previous efforts, there are also quite a few vignettes that tell their own little stories, such as Arya's list and the wordless introductions of the four core storylines: Daenerys' time in Qarth, Jon Snow's journey beyond the Wall, Theon's betrayal and the various schemes in King's Landing between Tyrion, Cersei, Littlefinger, Varys and Sansa.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mediaDesc">One thing I accomplished in this video that I haven't really been able to replicate in any of my future works is seamlessly cutting conversations together that have nothing to do with each other in a way that builds pace and has dramatic resonance (such examples of this include <a href="https://youtu.be/ZaoG-VuY5gA?t=3m15s" target="_blank">3:15-3:23</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZaoG-VuY5gA?t=3m38s" target="_blank">3:38-3:44</a>). Another technique I utilized was repurposing dialogue transposed on top of scenes that also have no direct relevance (other examples of this include <a href="https://youtu.be/ZaoG-VuY5gA?t=3m48s" target="_blank">3:48-3:55</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZaoG-VuY5gA?t=4m32s" target="_blank">4:32-4:38</a>).</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="centerText">I have ideas for a sequel to this video that I'll eventually make.</p>

This featured a lot more dialogue than my previous attempt, and a more effective dramatic thoroughline. It's not always well done though, some of the audio transitions are harsh and the cuts aren't always clean either. I can see a pretty big difference in the way I cut things when I made this compared to videos I've done more recently. This is a little more blunt.</p>

It was appropriate that Lost was used, since it's once of my favorite television shows of all time. Looking back on it I think it was an interesting experiment that proved that I would be able to create more music videos with this kind of visual quality and included some interesting comparison shots. This was also the first music video I ever made that included dialogue informing the narrative (not counting my failed experiment in my AMV <i>Brother</i>). This is a trend that I would continue and improve upon in future music videos.</p>
